Diff b/w spreadsheets and SQL tables?

1) In spreadsheets doesnot have a pre-define schema and columns(attributes) can hold(store) any type of data.

 ID		|	NAME	|	AGE 
 ----------------------------------
 1			john		67
 2			sam			34
 unknown	76			not define
 
But in SQL tables there is a pre-define schema and columns have a particular DATATYPE

COLUMN	  |	DATATYPE	
----------------------
ID		    integer		 
NAME		string		        datatypes defines
AGE			integer			---------------------->>>  	types of OPERATIONS performed on the COLUMN
data_join   timestamp
height      float

2)spreadsheets are usually disconnected, but 
		
					connected 
	SQL tables	 ------------>>>  FOREIGN KEYS
					 using
