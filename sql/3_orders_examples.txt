SELECT name, age , sal AS annual_salary,
annual_salary / 12 AS monthly_salary 
FROM Employees

OUPUT:annual_salary is Not found

Problem: Why b/c SELECT and Aliases(AS) are processed(READ) at same time 
hence SELECT is not aware of the new name assigned

Solution : Is to use the original column name of the table

SELECT name, age , salary AS annual_salary,
salary / 12 AS monthly_salary 
FROM Employees



SELECT name, level, level / 10 AS level_scaled
From Characters
WHERE level_scaled > 3

OUTPUT: level_scaled not found

Solution:
SELECT name, level, level / 10 AS level_scaled
From Characters
WHERE (level / 10) > 3
